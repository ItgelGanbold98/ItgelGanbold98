# 👋 Hi all, I’m Itgel

I am working towards getting my Master's in Computer Science at UCD and I have a Bachelor's in Theoretical Physics from UCD as well.

- 👀 I’m interested in all things problem-solving: coding, physics, mathematics and more! I love video games, art and history as well.
- 💞️ I have worked on a number of projects during my internship with the School of Physics.
- Not to mention the numerous projects that I have completed during my coursework and free time!
